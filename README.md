### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes I felt prepared for most. However, the adding and deleting features felt like they were a bit out of my range.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have loved to implement and adding and deleting function next to the search bar, or when you scroll to the end the option of adding a playlist would appear. I would also finish more sort options.

Next, I would make my code more concise, I need more practice with functions to make my code less repetitive.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Yes, I had trouble with rendering the playlistsa and making sure they updated after certain features changed their conditional rendering. Peers thought I should display options for the playlists.
